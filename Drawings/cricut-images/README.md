## Sizing ##
I had trouble importing the SVG format images into Cricut Design Space. Instead, I chose to use PNG images. Since they are rasterized, I exported them at a much higher resolution and then scaled them down after importing into Design Space. This ensures the cuts from a rasterized image are high quality.

To size them down to the correct size, I opened the SVG to determine the correct dimensions and then set the appropriate dimensions in Design Space before cutting.
