# Metal Main Crank Mod

This alteration is intended to alleviate issues with the main shaft breaking along the layer lines. The main shaft is removed from the 3D print models and replaced with a metal rod or tube (I used aluminum rod).

Print one of each file plus the 3 step drum pins from the non-modified Curta. Supports are needed for step_drum_top, step_drum_bottom, and rotation_blocker. The pins will likely require a brim and a bit of sanding after removing the brim.

## Parts and Tools Needed
* Conical Reamer for 1:50 3mm taper pins.
* 9mmx300mm rod or tube. If choosing tube, use at least a 1mm thick wall.
* M3x16mm Spring pin.
* Drill or drill press.
* 3mm drill bit.

## Preparing the Main Shaft / Axle
 * Cut the 300mm shaft down to 258mm. Use a narrow blade like a band saw or a pull saw. Keep the off cut.
 * Place the shaft into the top and bottom jigs with the build plate side down against your work surface or drill press table. Ensure that the jigs are fully seated against the top and bottom of the shaft.
 * Drill through the single vertical hole in the bottom jig's slanted surface with a 3mm bit. If using a hand drill, make sure you have a sacrificial piece of wood or other material below the jig.
 * Place the jig pin through the drilled hole to secure the shaft in place. All further drilling will be in reference to this hole in both distance and angle.
 * Turn the jigs over and rest them on the slanted faces ensuring the top jig remains fully seated on the shaft. Drill through the hole in the top of the shaft through the printed top jig with a 3mm bit.
 * Turn the jigs so that the two side holes in the bottom jig are upright and drill those two holes with the 3mm bit.
 * Use a small file or deburring tool to deburr all cuts and holes

## Assembly
 * Slide the rotation blocker over the bottom of the shaft past the first hole for the anti-reversal plate to the second hole (the first one drilled). Line up the drilled hole with the hole in the rotation blocker, and tap the spring pin into the hole to secure the rotation blocker to the main shaft.
 * Combine the step drum top and bottom using the same pins as with the non-modified Curta with some cyanoacrylate glue (superglue).
 * Glue the off cut of the main shaft into the offset hole in the top of the step drum.
 * Slide the completed step drum down the main shaft, aligning the hole in the wedge behind the teeth of the step drum with the hole above the rotation blocker which should be 90 degrees offset from the rotation blocker hole.
 * Holding the main shaft with the pin of the rotation blocker facing you and the flat side of the rotation blocker facing the left, rotate the step drum so that its the teeth are facing away from you.
 * Use the conical reamer to shape the hole in the printed part and the main shaft for the conical pin and tap the step drum pin into place. It should be secure, but don't use too much force.
 * Continue Curta assembly following the manual.
 * Towards the end of the build when afixing the crank to the main shaft, repeat use of the conical reamer and tap the main axle crank pin into place.
 * If disassembly is ever needed, tap the conical pins out in the opposite direction from the way they were installed.
