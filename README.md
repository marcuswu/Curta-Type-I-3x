# Curta-Type-I-3x
3x scale Curta Type I for FDM 3D printing

Please see the [BOM](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16EJePozXW-uC6UFISzyT2eMk7c8wh6v-EP5L1U8fzfM/edit?usp=sharing) for information about how to print the parts, what non-printed parts to gather, and suggestions on how to source them.

The manual should provide a rough idea how to assemble the calculator.
The [assembly video](https://youtu.be/zh2Z11miQ0w) should also help.

## Contributions
The calculator itself was originally designed by [Curt Herzstark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curt_Herzstark) and produced by Contina AG Mauren.
[mcmaven](https://www.thingiverse.com/mcmaven)'s [Curta Calculator Mods](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3126676) heavily inspired my changes to the carry levers. I highly recommend checking out his other changes too.
